## Analysis of different cancer treatments for Pymaceuticals Inc.
This project consists an analysis of different treatment regimens used for tumor growth in mice which is done by Pymaceuticals for their drug of interest Capomulin.<br>
It provides a summary statistics of tumor volume for each drug regimen.<br>
A bar plot shows the total number of timepoints for all miced tested for each regimen.<br>
A pie plot shows distribution of female and male mice in the study.<br>
It contains a quantitative analysis of final tumor volume among the top treatments and potential outliers across the regimens.<br>
A line plot of tumor volume and timepoints for a mouse treated with Capomulin.<br>
It calculates the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin treatment.<br>
An analysis is added at the top of the notebook to conclude the findings.<br>
